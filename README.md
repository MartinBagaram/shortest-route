# shortest-route
This is the **Short path** problem solved using 

> Djikarta algorithm

 in Java. The program builds a network of nodes and edges based on a text file it was fed and determine the best sequence for solving the problem.

The problem is of crucial importance in natural resources management in particular :

- Scheduling which forest stand should be harvested to reduce the distance of road build and/or reduce the travel time or distance

- The cost of each each could be the ecological vulnerability and thus show the route rangers and forest mangers should follow in order to reduce the ecological impact

- The application could be in the recreation or park. Which set of road arcs should be open to the public in order to reduce visits impact on ecological fragile ecosystems or to reduce the disturbance to wildlife.

- etc
